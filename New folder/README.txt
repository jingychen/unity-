I opened Glitch in my Oculus rift s, but it was not 360-degree environment. So I chose Unity.
And in this project I learned basic Unity knowledge and write two scripts.

It contains one skybox and 7 gameobjects and I used 2D images to constuct the scene. I used the movement of the sun and two stars and a picture of nebula to suggest the space.
The scale.cs is for the eye contraction and rotate.cs for the sun and the stars.
I want to apply gaze interaction to trigger my custom scripts but have no idea.

The skybox texture is downloaded from Unity Assets store "SpaceSkies Free" and other images are collected from Google.
